## Why I Made This Account
To keep a diary of my progression as a developer, be it directories I have stored or otherwise. Also, I want to learn to be more open as a developer by supporting others and accepting those willing to support me. Helping one another, I like the idea; but I want to see more of it in practice.

## My Vision
I want to realise my ideas if they can be helpful, whatever they may be, or to support ideas which I consider incredibly helpful.
